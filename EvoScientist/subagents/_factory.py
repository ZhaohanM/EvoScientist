"""Factory for building deployable sub-agent graphs from yaml definitions.

Lives in ``EvoScientist/subagents/`` next to the canonical yaml entries
because the factory is "build a graph from a sub-agent name" — a generic
construction utility, not a deployment concern. Any deployment surface
(``EvoScientist/langgraph_dev/``, future ``langgraph_platform/``, custom
servers) can call ``build_async_subagent_graph(name)`` to materialize the
runnable graph.

Reuses the main EvoScientist agent's chat model, backend, and middleware so
the deployed sub-agent has full capability parity with its in-process
synchronous counterpart: same workspace files, same ``/skills/`` and
``/memories/`` routes, same error-handling and context-overflow middleware.

"""Slash commands for TUI expert-skill selection.

``/experts`` — list installed expert skills.
``/expert <name>`` — toggle an expert into the current session's
``active_teams`` list; the next turn's ``configurable.active_teams`` picks
this up and ``ActiveTeamMiddleware`` biases the main-agent's delegation
toward the invited expert(s).
``/expert clear`` — reset the list.

User-facing verbs match the WebUI gallery: **invite** to add an expert,
**dismiss** to remove one. Internal state field stays ``active_teams``
for wire compatibility.

Backing store is ``ChannelRuntime.active_teams`` (see
``EvoScientist/commands/base.py``). WebUI users get the same effect via
its gallery + langgraph-sdk ``config.configurable``; these commands are
the TUI-side equivalent.

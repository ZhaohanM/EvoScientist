"""Skill-name-injecting AsyncSubAgentMiddleware for expert dispatch.

Upstream ``deepagents.AsyncSubAgentMiddleware`` hardcodes the invocation
input to ``{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": description}]}`` — no
way for ``start_async_task`` to pass per-run state to the target graph. That
blocks the generic-container async pattern we need for agent-teams' expert
dispatch (one container graph, parameterised by which skill is active via
``skill_name`` in the initial state).

Multiple community issues on the deepagents tracker target this gap
(``#2440``, ``#3838``, ``#4668``, ``#606``, ``#2512``) and the maintainers
have been closing implementation PRs (``#2617``, ``#3839``, ``#4669``) with
process-gate comments, none assigned. Upstream fix is not expected on any
predictable timeline; this subclass gives us the mechanism locally.

Design
------
- Subclass ``AsyncSubAgentMiddleware``; call ``super().__init__()`` for spec
  validation + default 5-tool build, then swap in a start tool that injects
  ``skill_name=subagent_type`` by construction (keeping check / update /
  cancel / list unchanged).
- The tool signature matches upstream exactly: ``(description, subagent_type,
  runtime)``. No LLM-visible ``payload`` field: every value the middleware
  can derive itself (the skill name) is injected inside the middleware, not
  entrusted to a channel the model can get wrong. Any run-specific
  information the model uniquely holds (e.g. the desired ``output_path``)
  belongs in the description string.
- Extend the ``AsyncSubAgent`` typed dict with an optional ``is_expert``
  marker so the middleware knows when to add ``skill_name`` to the run
  input. Standard specs (``writing-agent`` / ``data-analysis-agent`` /
  ``scheduler``) reach ``client.runs.create`` with the upstream shape.
- Resolve-on-miss: when ``start_async_task`` is asked for a
  ``subagent_type`` absent from ``agent_map`` — typically an expert
  installed after the agent was built — the tool runs one
  ``build_expert_async_subagent_specs`` walk and merges every unknown
  expert into ``agent_map`` — and into the optional second dispatch
  table, when one is supplied — before re-validating (see
  ``_resolve_merge_validate``). New experts become
  background-dispatchable the first time they are named, with no agent
  rebuild, no registry watcher, and no restart; in-turn ``task`` reach
  for a new expert still requires a rebuilt agent (``/new``). The merge
  and the map-iterating validation serialize on one per-instance lock
  (``self._resolve_lock``); the event loop never touches it — the async
  variant miss-checks by keyed lookup and does all lock work on the
  ``asyncio.to_thread`` worker.

If deepagents ever lands a skill-name-passthrough of its own, delete this
file and rebind ``EvoAsyncSubAgentMiddleware`` → ``AsyncSubAgentMiddleware``
in one commit; the state-schema shape on the container graph doesn't change.

Do NOT add ``from __future__ import annotations`` to this module. langchain's
``StructuredTool._injected_args_keys`` uses ``inspect.signature(fn)`` (raw
annotations, not ``get_type_hints``) to decide which parameters are injected
runtime args. With PEP 563 in effect ``runtime: ToolRuntime`` becomes the
string ``"ToolRuntime"``, fails the ``issubclass(type_, _DirectlyInjectedToolArg)``
check, and gets stripped from tool_input at parse time — the coroutine is
then called without ``runtime`` and raises ``TypeError``.

    Called from ``start_async_task`` only when ``subagent_type`` missed
    ``agent_map`` — the resolve-on-miss path that makes an expert installed
    mid-session dispatchable without an agent rebuild. Returns the
    refreshed ``_validate_agent_type`` error for *subagent_type*: ``None``
    when the walk resolved it, upstream's unknown-type message (with the
    now-updated allowed-type list) for a genuine miss. Both dicts are
    mutated in place; the middleware and its tools hold them by reference,
    so the update is visible to every tool that resolves a name at call
    time (start / check / update / cancel all reach ``agent_map`` or
    ``_ClientCache._agents``, which share the object).

    One walk, every unknown expert: ``build_expert_async_subagent_specs``
    already walks the whole skills tree, so merging every not-yet-known
    spec costs nothing extra and N newly installed experts resolve on the
    first miss rather than one walk each.

    ``setdefault`` semantics on both dicts — an existing entry is never
    overwritten. The middleware's constructor already raised on duplicate
    names at build time, so an overwrite here could only smuggle in a spec
    the running agent was not validated against.

    Known limitation — installs only, never uninstalls: the merge adds
    names, nothing removes them, so an expert uninstalled mid-session
    stays in the dispatch tables until the next agent rebuild (``/new``).
    Its runs fail late — the container graph reads the persona from disk
    at dispatch time and reports the unknown skill — rather than at this
    start-tool boundary.

    *cfg* is the config the agent was constructed with, threaded through
    the middleware. The specs must point at the same ``langgraph_dev_port``
    the construction-time specs used — re-deriving config from disk here
    (the builder's ``get_effective_config()`` fallback) would let a
    mid-session port change spec a newly resolved expert onto a port the
    running dev subprocess is not on: dispatch accepts the name and only
    ``runs.create`` fails, an advertise/provide split.

    *lock* serializes the merge AND the re-validation — both run under one
    acquisition — against every other ``_validate_agent_type`` reader of
    ``agent_map`` (the sync start tool's initial validation), which
    iterates the map to build its error string: an unsynchronized insert
    under that reader raises ``RuntimeError: dictionary changed size
    during iteration``. The skills-tree walk runs OUTSIDE the lock; only
    the ``setdefault`` loop and the validation — microseconds of pure
    dict operations — hold it. Keyed lookups (``_ClientCache.get_sync`` /
    ``get_async``, the update tool) are single GIL-protected operations
    and need no lock.

    ``watcher_agents`` is an optional second dispatch table, separate
    from ``agent_map``: when supplied, every merged expert is also
    ``setdefault``-ed into it so a caller-side consumer keyed by agent
    name sees the new expert. No in-tree caller supplies one today —
    the async-watcher middleware that did was removed in favor of the
    client-side state reader (completions are detected from thread
    state); the parameter stays for tests and external wiring.
    ``None`` (the default) skips the second merge; dispatch resolves
    through ``agent_map`` alone.

    an event loop must run it via ``asyncio.to_thread``.

"""``BackgroundExecutionMiddleware`` — background-process tools for the main agent.

Mirrors deepagents' ``AsyncSubAgentMiddleware`` shape (a middleware that owns a set of
tools). The tools are wrappers over :mod:`EvoScientist.background`, which holds the live,
process-level registry. They reuse the sandbox's ``validate_command`` so a background
launch cannot bypass the same safety checks as ``execute``.

Lifecycle mirror: each tool also writes a snapshot of the affected process(es) into the
``bg_processes`` thread-state channel (a merge-reducer dict keyed by ``process_id``,
modelled on deepagents' ``async_tasks``). The client detects a process exit by reading
that state through the gateway and polling ``gateway.get_process_status`` — the same
state-driven read path the async-task reader uses — so completion notifications work
across the CLI↔server process boundary. There is no in-process push: the daemon watcher
(``background._watch``) still records the exit in the registry, but nothing is enqueued
from it.

Naming: these manage OS *processes* (never "job" — that word is reserved-free; async
sub-agents are *tasks*, future cron is *schedules*).

This module intentionally does NOT use ``from __future__ import annotations``: the tools
inject ``ToolRuntime`` and return ``Command``, and ``StructuredTool`` inspects the raw
signature to wire the injected runtime — PEP 563 stringized annotations break that
detection (same reason as ``middleware/expert_async_subagent.py``).

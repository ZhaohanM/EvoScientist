"""Memory middleware for EvoScientist.

The middleware owns the markdown files under ``/memories/profile/``: it creates
them when missing, migrates the old ``/memories/MEMORY.md`` file when present,
injects either profile contents or profile file pointers into model calls, and
points agents at observation memory under ``/memories/observations/``. Agents
still read and edit profile files through their normal ``/memories/...`` tools;
observation writes go through the structured ``record_observation`` tool.

These profile notes live under `/memories/profile/`.
Every agent can read and update them with normal file tools.

Use these files for:

- `/memories/profile/USER_PROFILE.md`: facts and preferences about the user.
- `/memories/profile/RESEARCH_TASTE.md`: research interests, standards, methods that fit, and things to avoid.
- `/memories/profile/projects/{project_id}/PROJECT_PROFILE.md`: conventions, commands, and pitfalls for this workspace.

Read the relevant file before editing it. Add small bullets under existing
headings, skip duplicates, and leave out temporary task state.

Profile update scope:
- Review the profile context below and the latest trajectory for stable changes
  to user preferences, research taste, collaboration style, or project
  conventions.
- Do not infer profile facts from task content alone. Profile updates need
  stable evidence about the user, their preferences, or this project.
- When a profile update is warranted, edit the relevant
  `/memories/profile/...` file with a small deduplicated bullet under an
  existing heading.
- When the turn only contains task progress, subagent findings, search results,
  command output, or temporary run context, leave profile files unchanged.

Observation memory lives under `/memories/observations/`:
- `/memories/observations/global/`: cross-project observations.
- `/memories/observations/projects/{project_id}/`: observations for this workspace.

Required memory preflight:
- For coding, debugging, research, planning, or evaluation tasks, complete this
  preflight before inspecting workspace/task files, running commands, editing
  files, delegating, using `code_interpreter`, or making a plan.
- First use the inlined observation index. If a listed summary clearly matches
  the task, call `read_memory` with that observation ID.
- Otherwise, call `search_observations` with a few distinctive words or short
  phrases that describe the issue, constraint, procedure, or prior result to
  find. If one query misses, try 1-3 focused variants. Use `mode=regex` only
  when exact grep-like matching is required. If a result looks promising but
  the snippet is not enough to act on confidently, call `read_memory` with its
  observation ID.
- After this preflight, use direct tools or `code_interpreter` to do or batch
  the actual workspace work as appropriate.
- Mention the result briefly before continuing: observation IDs used, or that
  no relevant observation was found. Keep this preflight short.
"""

OBSERVATION_MEMORY_WRITE_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Call `record_observation` only for durable, non-obvious, evidence-backed
information that is not already in memory and is likely to change future behavior:
recurring constraints, important decisions, failed approaches future agents might
repeat, verified outcomes, or tool/workflow workarounds.
Provide a one-line `summary` that is specific enough for future agents to decide
whether to read the full observation.

Distill reusable insight rather than saving raw task output or a transcript of
what happened.

Use procedural/global for general tool or platform behavior that can recur
outside this workspace; use project scope only for workspace-specific facts,
commands, resources, evaluation setup, or configuration. Do not hand-write
observation files.
Do not record routine progress, raw traces, ordinary command output, citation
lists without synthesis, simple filesystem listings, temporary paths/run ids,
one-off environment discoveries, or task summaries."""
